- üìä Normalizes product specifications and filters duplicates
- üí¨ Analyzes customer reviews using LLMs
- üß† Ranks items using a customizable value score (specs √ó price √ó sentiment)
- üìù Returns a report of top picks with reasoning, links, and scores

## üß© How It Works (Pipeline)

### 1. `user_input_agent.py`
Parses user query to extract:
- Product category
- Desired features
- Budget range
- Constraints (e.g. ‚Äúbattery life > 10h‚Äù)

### 2. `search_agent.py`
Scrapes or queries external APIs to find matching products.
Returns raw product data (titles, specs, price, URL, reviews).

### 3. `data_agent.py`
Cleans and structures data:
- Normalize units (e.g., GB, mAh)
- Remove duplicates
- Standardize fields across vendors

### 4. `review_agent.py`
Uses LLM (OpenAI, HF, etc.) to:
- Summarize reviews
- Detect common pros/cons
- Flag misleading patterns

### 5. `ranking_agent.py`
Applies a scoring function: ValueScore = (spec_weight √ó performance) + (sentiment_weight √ó review_score) - price_penalty
This agent ranks the best-value products per user criteria.

### 6. `report_agent.py`
Generates a final markdown or web-ready report:
- Top 3 picks
- Key specs
- Value scores
- Short AI-generated rationale
- Purchase links
